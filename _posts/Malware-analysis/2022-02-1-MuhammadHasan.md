# The gap between the market and collage

## what's the gap?

The collage teaches subjects unrelated to the market. The collage tries its best -in its sight- to overcome the Ignorance of the student. By studing subjects related to the technology with no linking to each other or telling us what's its worth.

## How to overcome this gap?

> You don't know what you don't know.

Since the begining of student's learning process, the student is guided to what should he do or study. When it comes to the market the student is left alone to face this problem by himself. So the student should be guided through this process to produce in the market. If the student didn't find the mentor or the guide, he tries to make his way and enters the market with the hard way By obligating himself and study. Using this way the student may be will lose his goal from time to time but he will continue. Because the student only knows that he must study to get to the next level as usual but this time is not only studing collage subjects but tring to specifiy a field to get into it. If you didn't do that you will find yourself broke.

# If universities and professors admit they are guilty
