# Introduction

This episode talks about SW engineering and what basics you should have and what interviewers concentrate on in the interview and what skills you should have.

# What programming languages

For SW, you should learn one general programming language before graduation such as `python`, `JS`, or `C#` depending on the market in your country. And not only the basics of the programming language but also OOP, algrothms, and data structures. And learning relational 
databases such as SQL, or Oracle. 

# What tools

Learning how to use tools helping you in your daily work such as `Git`.

# What skills

A critical skill you should have is communication skills. How to show your ideas and how to speak infront of people and make a represntation. You must know how to read and speak and listen in English language whatever your accent is. because most learning materials are in English language.

# What basics

You should have strong basics not deep in Networking and linux based OS. 

# What makes you continue learning

And i disagree in this topic which is you need to passion to learn Not only passion it's to take this as responsiblity then passion 
then working hard. If you try this you will breathe fire as a dragon. After gaining knowledge from courses you need to practice such as building a project.
